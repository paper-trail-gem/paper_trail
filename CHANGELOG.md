## 4.0.0 (2015-07-30)

This major release adds JSON column support in PostgreSQL, limited support for
versioning associations, various new configuration options, and a year's worth
of bug fixes. Thanks to everyone who helped test the two betas and two release
candidates.

### Breaking Changes

- Using a Rails initializer to reopen PaperTrail::Version or otherwise extend
  PaperTrail is no longer recommended. An alternative is described in the
  readme. See https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/pull/557 and
  https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/pull/492.
- If you depend on the `RSpec` or `Cucumber` helpers, you must
  [require them in your test helper](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail#testing).
- [#566](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/pull/566) - Removed deprecated
  methods `paper_trail_on` and `paper_trail_off`. Use `paper_trail_on!` and
  `paper_trail_off!` instead.
- [#458](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/pull/458) - Version metadata
  (the `:meta` option) from AR attributes for `create` events will now save the
  current value instead of `nil`.
- [#391](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/issues/391) - `object_changes`
  value should dump to `YAML` as a normal `Hash` instead of an
  `ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess`.
- [#375](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/pull/375) /
  [#374](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/issues/374) /
  [#354](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/issues/354) /
  [#131](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/issues/131) -
  Versions are now saved with an `after_` callback, instead of a `before_`
  callback. This ensures that the timestamp field for a version matches the
  corresponding timestamp in the model.
- `3da1f104` - `PaperTrail.config` and `PaperTrail.configure` are now
  identical: both return the `PaperTrail::Config` instance and also
  yield it if a block is provided.

### Added

- [#525](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/issues/525) /
  [#512](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/pull/512) -

- [#507](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/pull/507) -
  New option: `:save_changes` controls whether or not to save changes to the
  `object_changes` column (if it exists).
- [#500](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/pull/500) - Support for
  passing an empty array to the `on` option (`on: []`) to disable all
  automatic versioning.

  generator will warn the user if the migration they are attempting to
  generate already exists.
- [#484](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/pull/484) - Support for
  [PostgreSQL's `JSONB` Type](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/datatype-json.html)
  for storing `object` and `object_changes`.
- [#439](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/pull/439) /
  [#12](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/issues/12) -
  Support for versioning associations (has many, has one, etc.) one level deep.
- [#420](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/issues/420) - Add
  `VersionConcern#where_object_changes` instance method; acts as a helper for
  querying against the `object_changes` column in versions table.
- [#416](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/issues/416) - Added a
  `config` option for enabling/disabling utilization of

- [#347](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/pull/347) - Autoload
  `ActiveRecord` models in via a `Rails::Engine` when the gem is used with
  `Rails`.

### Fixed

- [#563](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/pull/563) - Fixed a bug in
  `touch_with_version` so that it will still create a version even when the
  `on` option is, e.g. `[:create]`.
- [#541](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/pull/541) -
  `PaperTrail.config.enabled` should be Thread Safe

  [#428](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/issues/428) -
  `model_instance.dup` does not need to be invoked when examining what the
  instance looked like before changes were persisted, which avoids issues if a

  Sinatra.
- [#381](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/issues/381) - Fix `irb`
  warning: `can't alias context from irb_context`. `Rspec` and `Cucumber`
  helpers should not be loaded by default, regardless of whether those
  libraries are loaded.
- [#248](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/issues/248) - In MySQL, to
  prevent truncation, generated migrations now use `longtext` instead of `text`.
- Methods handling serialized attributes should fallback to the currently set
  Serializer instead of always falling back to `PaperTrail::Serializers::YAML`.

    Add `VersionConcern#where_object` instance method; acts as a helper for querying against the `object` column in versions table.
  - [#373](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/pull/373) - Fix default sort order for the `versions` association in `ActiveRecord` 4.1.
  - [#372](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/pull/372) - Use [Arel](https://github.com/rails/arel) for SQL construction.
  - [#365](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/issues/365) - `VersionConcern#version_at` should return `nil` when receiving a timestamp
    that occured after the object was destroyed.
  - Expand `PaperTrail::VERSION` into a module, mimicking the form used by Rails to give it some additional modularity & versatility.
  - Fixed `VersionConcern#index` instance method so that it conforms to using the primary key for ordering when possible.

## 3.0.2

  - [#357](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/issues/357) - If a `Version` instance is reified and then persisted at that state,
    it's timestamp attributes for update should still get `touch`ed.
  - [#351](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/pull/351) / [#352](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/pull/352) -
    `PaperTrail::Rails::Controller` should hook into all controller types, and should not get loaded unless `ActionController` is.
  - [#346](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/pull/346) - `user_for_paper_trail` method should accommodate different types
    for return values from `current_user` method.
  - [#344](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/pull/344) - Gem is now tested against `MySQL` and `PostgreSQL` in addition to `SQLite`.
  - [#317](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/issues/317) / [#314](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/issues/314) -
    `versions` should default to ordering via the primary key if it is an integer to avoid timestamp comparison issues.
  - `PaperTrail::Cleaner.clean_versions!` should group versions by `PaperTrail.timestamp_field` when deciding which ones to
    keep / destroy, instead of always grouping by the `created_at` field.
  - If a `Version` instance is reified and then persisted at that state, it's source version
    (`model_instance#version_association_name`, usually `model_instance#version`) will get cleared since persisting it causes it to
    become the live instance.
  - If `destroy` actions are tracked for a versioned model, invoking `destroy` on the model will cause the corresponding version that
    gets generated to be assigned as the source version (`model_instance#version_association_name`, usually `model_instance#version`).

    instead of `current_user` (if `current_user` is defined).
  - [#313](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/pull/313) - Make the `Rails::Controller` helper compatible with
    `ActionController::API` for compatibility with the [`rails-api`](https://github.com/rails-api/rails-api) gem.
  - [#312](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/issues/312) - Fix RSpec `with_versioning` class level helper method.
  - `model_instance.without_versioning` now yields the `model_instance`, enabling syntax like this:
    `model_instance.without_versioning { |obj| obj.update_attributes(:name => 'value') }`.
  - Deprecated `Model.paper_trail_on` and `Model.paper_trail_off` in favor of bang versions of the methods.

## 2.7.2
