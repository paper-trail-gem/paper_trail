- None

### Fixed

- None

### Dependencies

- Add support for Rails 7.1
- Add support for Ruby 3.2

## 15.0.0 (2023-08-06)

### Breaking Changes

- None

### Added

- [#1416](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/1416) - Adds a
  model-configurable option `synchronize_version_creation_timestamp` which, if
  set to false, opts out of synchronizing timestamps between `Version.created_at`
  and the record's `updated_at`.

### Fixed

- [#1422](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/1422) - Fix the
  issue that unencrypted plaintext values are versioned with ActiveRecord
  encryption (since Rails 7) when using JSON serialization on PostgreSQL json
  columns.
- [#1414](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/1414) - When
  generating the migration, the version table will use uuid as primary key type
  if `--uuid` flag is specified.

### Dependencies

- Drop support for Rails 6.0, which [reached EoL on 2023-06-01][2]
- Drop support for Ruby 2.7, which [reached EoL on 2023-03-31][3]

## 14.0.0 (2022-11-26)

### Breaking Changes

- [#1399](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/1399) - Same
  change re: `YAML.safe_load` as in 13.0.0, but this time for Rails 6.0 and 6.1.
  - This change only affects users whose `versions` table has `object` or
    `object_changes` columns of type `text`, and who use the YAML serializer. People
    who use the JSON serializer, or those with `json(b)` columns, are unaffected.
  - Please see [doc/pt_13_yaml_safe_load.md](doc/pt_13_yaml_safe_load.md) for details.
- [#1406](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/1406) -
  Certain [Metadata][1] keys are now forbidden, like `id`, and `item_type`.
  These keys are reserved by PT.
  - This change is unlikely to affect anyone. It is not expected that anyone
    uses these metadata keys. Most people probably don't use PT metadata at all.

### Dependencies

- Drop support for Rails 5.2, which reached EoL on 2022-06-01
- Drop support for Ruby 2.6, which reached EoL on 2022-03-31
- Drop support for request_store < 1.4

### Added

- None

### Fixed

- [#1395](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/issues/1395) -
  Fix incorrect `Version#created_at` value when using
  `PaperTrail::RecordTrail#update_columns`
- [#1404](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/1404) -
  Delay referencing ActiveRecord until after Railtie is loaded
- Where possible, methods which are not part of PaperTrail's public API have
  had their access changed to private. All of these methods had been clearly
  marked as `@api private` in the documentation, for years. This is not expected
  to be a breaking change.

## 13.0.0 (2022-08-15)

### Breaking Changes

- For Rails >= 7.0, the default serializer will now use `YAML.safe_load` unless
  `ActiveRecord.use_yaml_unsafe_load`. This change only affects users whose
  `versions` table has `object` or `object_changes` columns of type `text`, and
  who use the YAML serializer. People who use the JSON serializer, or those with
  `json(b)` columns, are unaffected. Please see
  [doc/pt_13_yaml_safe_load.md](doc/pt_13_yaml_safe_load.md) for details.

### Added

## 12.3.0 (2022-03-13)

### Breaking Changes

- None

### Added

- [#1371](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/1371) - Added
  `in_after_callback` argument to `PaperTrail::RecordTrail#save_with_version`,
  to allow the caller to indicate if this method is being called during an
  `after` callback. Defaults to `false`.
- [#1374](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/1374) - Added
  option `--uuid` when generating new migration. This can be used to set the
  type of item_id column to uuid for use with paper_trail on a database that
  uses uuid as primary key.

### Fixed

- [#1373](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/issues/1373) - Add
  CLI option to use uuid type for item_id when generating migration.
- [#1376](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/1376) - Create a
  version record when associated object is touched. Restores the behavior of
  PaperTrail < v12.1.0.

## 12.1.0 (2021-08-30)

### Breaking Changes

- None

### Added

- [#1292](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/1292) -
  `where_attribute_changes` queries for versions where the object's attribute
  changed to or from any values.
- [#1291](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/1291) -
  `where_object_changes_to` queries for versions where the object's attributes

### Fixed

- [#1285](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/1285) -
  For ActiveRecord >= 6.0, the `touch` callback will no longer create a new
  `Version` for skipped or ignored attributes.
- [#1309](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/1309) -
  Removes `item_subtype` requirement when specifying model-specific limits.
- [#1333](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/1333) -
  Improve reification of STI models that use `find_sti_class`/`sti_class_for`
  to customize single table inheritance.

## 12.0.0 (2021-03-29)

### Breaking Changes

- [#1281](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/1281) Rails:
  Instead of an `Engine`, PT now provides a `Railtie`, which is simpler.
  This was not expected to be a breaking change, but has caused trouble for
  some people:
  - Issue with the deprecated `autoloader = :classic` setting
    (https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/issues/1305)
- Rails: The deprecated `config.paper_trail` configuration technique
  has been removed. This configuration object was deprecated in 10.2.0. It only
  had one key, `config.paper_trail.enabled`. Please review docs section [2.d.
  Turning PaperTrail
  Off](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/#2d-turning-papertrail-off)
  for alternatives.

### Added

- `where_object_changes_from` queries for versions where the object's attributes
  changed from one set of known values to any other set of values.

### Fixed

- [#1281](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/1281) Rails:
  Instead of an `Engine`, PT now provides a `Railtie`, which is simpler.
- Expand kwargs passed to `save_with_version` using double splat operator - Rails 6.1 compatibility
- [#1287](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/issues/1287) - Fix 'rails db:migrate' error when run against an app with mysql2 adapter

### Dependencies

## 11.1.0 (2020-12-16)

### Breaking Changes

- None

### Added

- [#1272](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/issues/1272) -
  Rails 6.1 compatibility

### Fixed

- None

## 11.0.0 (2020-08-24)

### Breaking Changes

- [#1221](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/1221)
  If you use the experimental association-tracking feature, and you forget to
  install the `paper_trail-association_tracking` gem, then, when you call
  `track_associations=` you will get a `NoMethodError` instead of the previous
  detailed error. Normally the removal of such a temporary warning would not be
  treated as a breaking change, but since this relates to PT-AT, it seemed
  warranted.
- `VersionConcern#sibling_versions` is now private, and its arity has changed.

### Added

- None

### Fixed

- [#1242](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/issues/1242) -
  Generator make wrong migration for Oracle database

- [#1238](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/1238) -
  Query optimization in `reify`

- [#1256](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/1256) -
  Skip version for timestamp when changed attributed is ignored via Hash

### Dependencies

- Drop support for rails <= 5.1, which [reached EOL when 6.0 was released][2]
- Drop support for ruby 2.3 (reached EOL on 2019-04-01)

## 10.3.1 (2019-07-31)

### Breaking Changes

- None

### Added

- None

### Fixed

- None

### Dependencies

  contributors to install incompatible versions of ActiveRecord.
  See discussion in paper_trail/compatibility.rb

## 10.3.0 (2019-04-09)

### Breaking Changes

- None

### Added

- [#1194](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/1194) -
  Added a 'limit' option to has_paper_trail, allowing models to override the
  global `PaperTrail.config.version_limit` setting.

### Fixed

- [#1196](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/1196) -
  In the installation migration, change `versions.item_id` from 4 byte integer
  to 8 bytes (bigint).

## 10.2.1 (2019-03-14)

### Breaking Changes

- None

### Added

- None

### Fixed

- [#1184](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/1184) -
  No need to calculate previous values of skipped attributes
- [#1188](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/1188) -
  Optimized the memory allocations during the building of every particular
  Version object. That can help a lot for heavy bulk processing.
  In additional we advise to use `json[b]` DB types for `object`
  and `object_changes` Version columns, in order to reach best possible
  RAM performance.

## 10.2.0 (2019-01-31)

### Deprecated

- [#1176](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/1176) -
  `config.paper_trail.enabled`

## 10.1.0 (2018-12-04)

### Breaking Changes

- None

### Deprecated

- [#1158](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/1158) - Passing
  association name as `versions:` option or Version class name as `class_name:`
  options directly to `has_paper_trail`. Use `has_paper_trail versions: {name:
  :my_name, class_name: "MyVersionModel"}` instead.

### Added

- [#1166](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/1166) -

- [#1158](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/1158) — Add the
  ability to pass options, such as `scope` or `extend:` to the `has_many
  :versions` association macro.
- [#1172](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/1172) -
  Support rails 6.0.0.alpha

### Fixed

- None

## 10.0.1 (2018-09-01)

### Breaking Changes

- None

### Added

- None

### Fixed

- [#1150](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/1150) - When PT-AT
  is not loaded, and someone sets `track_associations = false`, it should
  `warn`, not `raise`.

## 10.0.0 (2018-09-01)

PT 10 tackles some tough issues that required breaking changes. We fixed a
rare issue with STI, and saved major disk space in databases with tens
of millions of version records. Special thanks to @lorint and @seanlinsley,
respectively.

### Breaking changes affecting most people

- [#1132](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/1132) - Removed a
  dozen methods deprecated in PT 9. Make sure you've addressed all deprecation
  warnings before upgrading.

### Breaking changes affecting fewer people

- [db9c392d](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/commit/db9c392d) -
  `paper_trail-association_tracking` is no longer a runtime dependency. If you
  use it (`track_associations = true`) you must now add it to your own `Gemfile`.
  See also [PT-AT #7](https://github.com/westonganger/paper_trail-association_tracking/issues/7)
- [#1130](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/1130) -
  Removed `save_changes`. For those wanting to save space, it's more effective
  to drop the `object` column. If you need ultimate control over the
  `object_changes` column, you can write your own `object_changes_adapter`.

### Breaking changes most people won't care about

- [#1121](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/issues/1121) -
  `touch` now always inserts `null` in `object_changes`.
- [#1123](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/1123) -
  `object_changes` is now populated on destroy in order to make
  `where_object_changes` usable when you've dropped the `object` column.
  Sean is working on an optional backport migration and will post about it in
  [#1099](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/issues/1099) when
  he's done.

### Added

- [#1099](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/issues/1099) -
  Ability to save ~50% storage space by making the `object` column optional.
  Note that this disables `reify` and `where_object`.

### Fixed

- [#594](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/issues/594) -
  A rare issue with reification of STI subclasses, affecting only PT-AT users
  who have a model with mutliple associations, whose foreign keys are named the
  same, and whose foreign models are STI with the same parent class. This fix
  requires a schema change. See [docs section 4.b.1 The optional `item_subtype`
  column](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail#4b-associations) for
  instructions.

## 9.2.0 (2018-06-09)

### Breaking Changes

- None

### Added

- [#1070](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/issues/1070) -
  The experimental associations tracking feature has been moved to a separate
  gem, [paper_trail-association_tracking](https://github.com/westonganger/paper_trail-association_tracking). PT will,
  for now, have a runtime dependency on this new gem. So, assuming the gem
  extraction goes well, no breaking changes are anticipated.
- [#1093](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/1093) -
  `PaperTrail.config.object_changes_adapter` - Expert users can write their own
  adapter to control how the changes for each version are stored in the
  object_changes column. An example of this implementation using the hashdiff
  gem can be found here:
  [paper_trail-hashdiff](https://github.com/hashwin/paper_trail-hashdiff)

### Fixed

- None

## 9.1.1 (2018-05-30)

### Breaking Changes

- [#1098](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/1098) - Fix
  regression in 9.1.0 re: generator `--with-associations`

## 9.1.0 (2018-05-23)

### Breaking Changes

- None

### Added

- [#1091](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/1091) -
  `PaperTrail.config.association_reify_error_behaviour` - For users of the
  experimental association tracking feature. Starting with PT 9.0.0, reification
  of `has_one` associations is stricter. This option gives users some choices
  for how to handle the `PaperTrail::Reifiers::HasOne::FoundMoreThanOne` error
  introduced in PT 9. See README section 4.b.1. "Known Issues" for more details.

### Fixed

- None

## 9.0.2 (2018-05-14)

### Breaking Changes

- None

### Added

- None

### Fixed

- [#1084](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/1084)
  The `touch` callback (added in 9.0.0) now inserts the correct value into
  the `versions.object` column.

### Other

- Stop testing against rails 5.0, which reached EoL on 2018-04-15, when 5.2
  was released, per the [rails maintenance
  policy](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/maintenance_policy.html)

## 9.0.1 (2018-04-23)

### Breaking Changes

- None

### Added

- [#1076](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/issues/1076)
  Add `save_with_version`, a replacement for deprecated method
  `touch_with_version`. Not exactly the same, it's a save, not a touch.
- [#1074](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/1074)
  `PaperTrail.request do ... end` now returns the value the given block.

### Fixed

- None

## 9.0.0 (2018-03-26)

### Breaking Changes, Major

- [#1063](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/1063) - `touch` will now
  create a version. This can be configured with the `:on` option. See
  documentation section 2.a. "Choosing Lifecycle Events To Monitor".
- Drop support for ruby 2.2, [whose EoL is the end of March,
  2018](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2017/09/14/ruby-2-2-8-released/)
- PaperTrail now uses `frozen_string_literal`, so you should assume that all
  strings it returns are frozen.
- Using `where_object_changes` to read YAML from a text column will now raise
  error, was deprecated in 8.1.0.

### Breaking Changes, Minor

- Removed deprecated `Version#originator`, use `#paper_trail_originator`
- Using paper_trail.on_destroy(:after) with ActiveRecord's
  belongs_to_required_by_default will produce an error instead of a warning.
- Removed the `warn_about_not_setting_whodunnit` controller method. This will
  only be a problem for you if you are skipping it, eg.
  `skip_after_action :warn_about_not_setting_whodunnit`, which few people did.

### Deprecated

- [#1063](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/1063) -
  `paper_trail.touch_with_version` is deprecated in favor of `touch`.
- [#1033](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/1033) - Request variables
  are now set using eg. `PaperTrail.request.whodunnit=` and the old way,
  `PaperTrail.whodunnit=` is deprecated.

### Added

- [#1067](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/1033) -
  Add support to Rails 5.2.
- [#1033](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/1033) -
  Set request variables temporarily using a block, eg.
  `PaperTrail.request(whodunnit: 'Jared') do .. end`
- [#1037](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/1037) Add `paper_trail.update_columns`
- [#961](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/issues/961) - Instead of
  crashing when misconfigured Custom Version Classes are used, an error will be
  raised earlier, with a much more helpful message.
- Failing to set PaperTrail.config.track_associations will no longer produce
  a warning. The default (false) will remain the same.

### Fixed

- [#1051](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/issues/1051) - `touch_with_version`
  should always create a version, regardles of the `:only` option
- [#1047](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/issues/1047) - A rare issue
  where `touch_with_version` saved less data than expected, but only when the
  update callback was not installed, eg. `has_paper_trail(on: [])`
- [#1042](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/issues/1042) - A rare issue
  with load order when using PT outside of rails
- [#594](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/issues/594) - Improved the
  error message for a very rare issue in the experimental association tracking
  feature involving two has_one associations, referencing STI models with the
  same base class, and the same foreign_key.

## 4.0.0 (2015-07-30)

This major release adds JSON column support in PostgreSQL, limited support for
versioning associations, various new configuration options, and a year's worth
of bug fixes. Thanks to everyone who helped test the two betas and two release
candidates.

### Breaking Changes

- Using a Rails initializer to reopen PaperTrail::Version or otherwise extend
  PaperTrail is no longer recommended. An alternative is described in the
  readme. See https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/557 and
  https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/492.
- If you depend on the `RSpec` or `Cucumber` helpers, you must
  [require them in your test helper](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail#testing).
- [#566](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/566) - Removed deprecated
  methods `paper_trail_on` and `paper_trail_off`. Use `paper_trail_on!` and
  `paper_trail_off!` instead.
- [#458](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/458) - Version metadata
  (the `:meta` option) from AR attributes for `create` events will now save the
  current value instead of `nil`.
- [#391](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/issues/391) - `object_changes`
  value should dump to `YAML` as a normal `Hash` instead of an
  `ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess`.
- [#375](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/375) /
  [#374](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/issues/374) /
  [#354](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/issues/354) /
  [#131](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/issues/131) -
  Versions are now saved with an `after_` callback, instead of a `before_`
  callback. This ensures that the timestamp field for a version matches the
  corresponding timestamp in the model.
- `3da1f104` - `PaperTrail.config` and `PaperTrail.configure` are now
  identical: both return the `PaperTrail::Config` instance and also
  yield it if a block is provided.

- [#404](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/issues/404) /
  [#428](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/issues/428) -
  `model_instance.dup` does not need to be invoked when examining what the
  instance looked like before changes were persisted, which avoids issues if a
  3rd party has overriden the `dup` behavior. Also fixes errors occuring when
  a user attempts to update the inheritance column on an STI model instance in
  `ActiveRecord` 4.1.x
- [#427](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/427) - Fix `reify`

- [#248](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/issues/248) - In MySQL, to
  prevent truncation, generated migrations now use `longtext` instead of `text`.
- Methods handling serialized attributes should fallback to the currently set
  Serializer instead of always falling back to `PaperTrail::Serializers::YAML`.

    `Model.paper_trail_off` to have display correct version number the methods
    will be removed (`4.0`)

## 3.0.8

    will be re-introduced in version `4.0`.
  - [#398](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/398) - Only require the `RSpec` helper if `RSpec::Core` is required.

## 3.0.3
*This version was yanked from RubyGems and has been replaced by version `3.0.5`, which is almost identical, but does not eager load
in the `PaperTrail::Version` class through a `Rails::Engine` when the gem is used on Rails since it was causing issues for some users.*

  - [#386](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/issues/386) - Fix eager loading of `versions` association with custom class name
    in `ActiveRecord` 4.1.
  - [#384](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/issues/384) - Fix `VersionConcern#originator` instance method.
  - [#383](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/383) - Make gem compatible with `ActiveRecord::Enum` (available in `ActiveRecord` 4.1+).
  - [#380](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/380) / [#377](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/issues/377) -
    Add `VersionConcern#where_object` instance method; acts as a helper for querying against the `object` column in versions table.
  - [#373](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/373) - Fix default sort order for the `versions` association in `ActiveRecord` 4.1.
  - [#372](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/372) - Use [Arel](https://github.com/rails/arel) for SQL construction.
  - [#365](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/issues/365) - `VersionConcern#version_at` should return `nil` when receiving a timestamp
    that occured after the object was destroyed.
  - Expand `PaperTrail::VERSION` into a module, mimicking the form used by Rails to give it some additional modularity & versatility.
  - Fixed `VersionConcern#index` instance method so that it conforms to using the primary key for ordering when possible.

## 3.0.2

  - [#357](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/issues/357) - If a `Version` instance is reified and then persisted at that state,
    it's timestamp attributes for update should still get `touch`ed.
  - [#351](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/351) / [#352](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/352) -

    `versions` should default to ordering via the primary key if it is an integer to avoid timestamp comparison issues.
  - `PaperTrail::Cleaner.clean_versions!` should group versions by `PaperTrail.timestamp_field` when deciding which ones to
    keep / destroy, instead of always grouping by the `created_at` field.
  - If a `Version` instance is reified and then persisted at that state, it's source version
    (`model_instance#version_association_name`, usually `model_instance#version`) will get cleared since persisting it causes it to
    become the live instance.
  - If `destroy` actions are tracked for a versioned model, invoking `destroy` on the model will cause the corresponding version that
    gets generated to be assigned as the source version (`model_instance#version_association_name`, usually `model_instance#version`).

## 3.0.1

  - [#340](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/issues/340) - Prevent potential error encountered when using the `InstallGenerator`

    to allow for generating a version while `touch`ing a model.
  - [#328](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/pull/328) / [#326](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/issues/326) /
    [#307](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/issues/307) - `Model.paper_trail_enabled_for_model?` and
    `model_instance.without_versioning` is now thread-safe.
  - [#316](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/issues/316) - `user_for_paper_trail` should default to `current_user.try(:id)`
    instead of `current_user` (if `current_user` is defined).
