# At this point, totally isolated unit tests could be run. But the PT test suite
# also has "integration" tests, via a "dummy" Rails app. Here, we boot that
# "dummy" app. The following process follows the same order, roughly, as a
# conventional Rails app.
#
# In the past, this boot process was partially implemented here, and partially
# in `dummy_app/config/*`. By consolidating it here,
#
# - It can better be understood, and documented in one place
# - It can more closely resemble a conventional app boot. For example, loading
# gems (like rspec-rails) _before_ loading the app.

# First, `config/boot.rb` would add gems to $LOAD_PATH.
Bundler.setup

# Then, the chosen components of Rails would be loaded. In our case, we only
# test with AR and AC. We require `logger` because `active_record` needs it.
require "logger"
require "active_record/railtie"
require "action_controller/railtie"

# Then, gems are loaded. In a conventional Rails app, this would be done with
# by the `Bundler.require` in `config/application.rb`.
